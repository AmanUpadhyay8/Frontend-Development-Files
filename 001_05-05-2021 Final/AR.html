            Two of the main components of any successful marketing campaign are reach and
            engagement. Before you plan your campaign you need to know where your target audience is -
            places they frequent, media they consume, people they follow, their tastes and preferences and
            so on. You may have killer content, but if you don’t plan well to reach your target group, your
            marketing content won’t meet its purpose.
          </p>

          <p>
            Digital media consumption was anyway on the rise with increasing internet and smartphone
            penetration - amidst the Coronavirus pandemic, the number of hours an average user spends
            has now grown by manifolds.
          </p>

          <p>
            Focusing specifically on social media, reports say an 87% rise in usage - not only more and
            more people are on social media but they are also spending more time. This is a welcome sign
            for brands to only get more visibility but to also ensure business continuity in these tough times.
            With rising popularity, Instagram pregnant with possibilities for brands. About 80% of its users
            follow at least one business page; signalling that people like to follow the brands they care
            about.
          </p>

          <p>
            While social media platforms can promise you the reach your marketing campaign needs, they
            do not confirm engagement or its impact. Graphic content like images, gifs and videos are more
            eye-catching and get more engagement over textual content. AR filters, however, have an
            average engagement time of 75 secs; four times more than video content. Brands spend heavily
            on video ads - spending a chunk of their marketing budget on animation and production costs.
            How much ever you spend on making that kickass video - you cannot ensure your viewer’s full
            and undivided attention. AR filters, on the other hand, by their nature demand engagement -
            people try different angles, they pose, make faces and give their unique personal touch to
            photos they click over your filter. Taco Bell, experimenting with Snap filters back in 2016 found
            that users spent an average of 24 secs before taking their pictures on Taco Bell’s AR filter.
          </p>

          <p>
            While more than a billion people are already using Spark AR filters, they are bound to get more
            popular and viral as they are by their nature a shareable form of content i.e. if you use a filter
            and take your picture, you would want to show it to your friends. Hence, with minimal spend,
            you can leverage the emerging tech and become a part of your user’s memories and they can
            become your brand ambassadors giving you a limitless reach.
